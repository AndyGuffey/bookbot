## About

BookBot is my first project from [Boot.dev](https://www.boot.dev) - a hands-on introduction to Python programming, file handling, and data analysis!

## What I Learned

- File I/O operations in Python
- Dictionary manipulation and sorting
- Command-line argument handling with `sys.argv`
- Function organization and imports
- String processing and character analysis
